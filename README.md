# JSON Decision Tree to Insights

This project aimed to transform decision trees defined in JSON format into meaningful insights. The primary goal was to provide an easy-to-understand summary of complex decision trees.

## Features
- Converts decision trees from JSON format into a readable summary.
- Designed to provide quick insights based on structured data.

## Challenges & Outcome
While the project started with ambitious goals, it did not fully succeed in its mission. Some key challenges include:
- The JSON structures contained highly numeric and hard-to-read information, making it difficult to present user-friendly insights.
- Certain edge cases in the data caused incomplete processing.
- The overall clarity and usability of the insights fell short of the intended goals.

Despite these limitations, the project offered valuable learning experiences in parsing complex JSON data and implementing decision-making algorithms.
